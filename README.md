# Neha Wecan2

## What is this?
This is a wheeler coding club group project. The purpose of it is to create a platform for people to find clubs/ activities and have a place for them to share information about them. This is very in development, so this will likely change often (can you tell I'm just yapping for a placeholder? :smile:)

## TODOs / Goals
This will be a website where people can post their clubs and activities on, and (if possible) share announcements to users who are in the club.
